#There are 5 requirements to have a romantic partner; singleness, maturity, intelligence, trust, love
#All these requirements can take any numerical value between 1 and 10 except for singleness which can only be 1
#Write a function, love that requires a user to input numerical values of singleness, maturity, intelligence, trust, love scores. Mind you that all requirements must have at least a numerical value of 1 but to be eligible for a romantic relationship, a person needs a total score of 21
#Your function outputs, “Congrats! You are closer to your desired romantic relationship” when a person has a score of at least 21
#Requirements:
#Your code must require the user to input their scores as numbers only and return, “Kindly input a number between 1 and 10" when a type, number is not entered by the user
#If a user inputs a number > or < 1 for singleness, your code should return, “Kindly input the number 1 here”
#Your function should contain at least one type
#There are at least 6 essentials here that you will be graded on of control flow, that is, at least one type of loop and at least one conditional
#Finally, it is important to note that your function does not take in any parameters
